    "In this notebook, we aim to understand customer behaviors and preferences by clustering them based on their culinary orders. By segmenting customers according to the types of cuisines they frequently order, we can uncover patterns in their consumption habits. This information will allow businesses to tailor marketing strategies, optimize inventory, and offer personalized recommendations, ultimately enhancing the customer experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary goal of this notebook is to apply unsupervised learning techniques to identify distinct customer groups based on their preference for different cuisines. We will utilize clustering algorithms such as KMeans, Hierarchical Clustering, SOM and Density-Based Algorithms to form these groups, and evaluate the clustering quality using various metrics like R², Silhouette Score, and Calinski-Harabasz Index.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the end, we will compare our best solutions and explore the best one, creating customer profiles for each segment and interpreting their characteristics. By doing so, we aim to provide actionable insights for businesses to enhance customer satisfaction and improve operational efficiencies.\n",
